# ðŸ¥¦ BMI Calculator

This is my so-to-say-solution to the [Body Mass Index calculator](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/body-mass-index-calculator-brrBkfSz1T) on Frontend Mentor. 

I **do not** have a **premium subscription** on Frontend Mentor platform, so my code is 100% authentic (no starter files being provided), and the only thing taken from the given challenge is the original design that I've done my best to implement.

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Select whether they want to use metric or imperial units
- Enter their height and weight
- See their BMI result, with their weight classification and healthy weight range
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

**Letz gooooo!** ðŸ’ª
